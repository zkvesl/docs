# Hull (Rust Harness)

The Hull is vesl's Rust harness. It loads a compiled Hoon kernel (JAM file), manages state, and exposes an HTTP API.

Think of it as the engine block — the Hoon kernel is the logic, the Hull is what makes it run.

## Responsibilities

- Boot the Hoon kernel as an embedded NockApp
- Ingest documents into a tip5 Merkle tree
- Retrieve chunks with keyword scoring
- Build and verify manifests (prompt integrity, proof paths)
- LLM inference (Ollama or deterministic stub)
- Schnorr signing and transaction construction
- On-chain settlement via Nockchain gRPC
- Expose REST API (`/ingest`, `/query`, `/prove`, `/status`, `/health`)
- Route between settlement modes (local, fakenet, dumbnet)

## Key modules

| Module | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| `merkle.rs` | tip5 Merkle tree, cross-runtime aligned with Hoon |
| `chain.rs` | On-chain settlement + confirmation via gRPC |
| `api.rs` | HTTP API server (axum) with 10 MB body limit |
| `tx_builder.rs` | Settlement transaction construction |
| `signing.rs` | Schnorr signing (returns `Result`, no panics) |
| `ingest.rs` | Document chunking into the tree |
| `llm.rs` | LLM integration (trait-based: Ollama or stub) |
| `noun_builder.rs` | Nock noun construction for kernel pokes |
| `retrieve.rs` | Keyword-based chunk retrieval with scoring |
| `config.rs` | Settlement config resolution (CLI > env > toml > defaults) |

## Server defaults

The HTTP server binds to `127.0.0.1:3000` by default. Pass `--bind-addr 0.0.0.0` to expose to the network. See the [CLI Reference](/reference/cli) for all flags.
